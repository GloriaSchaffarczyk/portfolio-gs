      <strong>Liability for Content</strong><br><br>
      The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 DDG under general laws. However, pursuant to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, as service providers, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. Liability in this regard is, however, only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of any such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.<br><br>
      <strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
      Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not discernible at the time of linking. A permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.<br><br>

This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.<br>
      We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br>
      The use of contact data published as part of the legal notice obligation by third parties for the transmission of unsolicited advertising and informational materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of these pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited promotional information, such as spam emails.<br>
